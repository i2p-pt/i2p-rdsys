i18n
====

Rdsys uses the module [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) for
internationalisation of its user-facing interfaces.  This document discusses
how one requests new translations (e.g. when we add new strings or modify
existing ones) and fetches finished translations (i.e. when volunteers finished
their translations).

Request new translations
------------------------

When we modify existing or add new strings, we must *extract* these strings, so
they can make their way to Transifex, where our volunteers take care of
translations.

Run the following command in rdsys's root directory to extract strings:

    make translations

This command writes translation files to the locales/ directory.
Files with the name translate.LOCALE.yaml have yet to be translated.  Once
that's done, rename these files to active.LOCALE.yaml.

Fetch finished translations
---------------------------

Once we pushed new strings to Transifex, our volunteers start translating them.
Every so often, we should fetch and incorporate updated translations.
